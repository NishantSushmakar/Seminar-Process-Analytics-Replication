Consider the following db schema: TABLE customer:
CREATE TABLE "customer" ("id" TEXT, "name" TEXT, "address" TEXT, PRIMARY KEY ("id"));

TABLE element_relation:
CREATE TABLE "element_relation" ("id" TEXT, "order" TEXT, "invoice" TEXT, PRIMARY KEY ("id"), FOREIGN KEY ("order") REFERENCES "order"("id"), FOREIGN KEY ("invoice") REFERENCES "invoice"("id"));

TABLE invoice:
CREATE TABLE "invoice" ("id" TEXT, "creation_date" DATETIME, "customer" TEXT, "amount" TEXT, PRIMARY KEY ("id"), FOREIGN KEY ("customer") REFERENCES "customer"("id"));

TABLE order:
CREATE TABLE "order" ("id" TEXT, "creation_date" DATETIME, "customer" TEXT, PRIMARY KEY ("id"), FOREIGN KEY ("customer") REFERENCES "customer"("id"));
