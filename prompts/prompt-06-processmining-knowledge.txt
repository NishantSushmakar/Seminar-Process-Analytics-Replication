## event
Each record in each table represents at least one event. 

## case notion
Use the column that occurs in the most tables and that is not used as timestamp or activity_id as the case notion.
When a table does not have a column that contains the selected case notion, combine the necessary tables to obtain this case notion.
Tables can be joined on attributes that have the exact same name. Use the attribute that holds the case notion as the case_id.

## activity label
Never use a column as activity_id that contains NUMERIC values or a column that is used to join with another table.
Columns that mostly contain TEXT values are candidates for the activity_id.
If multiple columns exist with TEXT values, use the column with the most detail. Base your selection on common knowledge related to elements of the name of the column. 
When a table has exactly one column containing a datetime format and no columns having a TEXT format, 
    then and only then, the name of the table is the value of the activity_id column.

When a table has at least two columns containing a datetime format, then each of these datetime values is an event.
When a table has at least two columns containing a datetime format,
    then and only then, for each of these columns concatenate the name of the table and the name of the column and use this as the value in the activity_id column. 

## timestamp
A record in the event log must always have a timestamp value that is not empty and not NULL.
Use for the timestamps the time format that occurs in the tables where the value originates from.

## event log
Remove duplicate records from the event log.
